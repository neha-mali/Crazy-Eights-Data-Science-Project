# Crazy-Eights-Data-Science-Project-

Game Summary -

For the purposes of this project, Crazy Eights is a card game between 2 to 4 players.  The objective of the game is to discard (or ‘play’) all your cards and the first player to do so, wins.
The game starts by dealing 7 cards from the deck to each player and turning one card face up which forms the base of the discard pile.  The player to the left of the dealer plays first.
When it is their turn, a player can play a card that either matches the face value or the suit of the top card in the discard pile.
Alternatively, the player can play an 8 (i.e. a card with a face value of 8) and call out a suit of their choosing.  The next player must play an 8 or a card of that suit (or draw up to 3 cards from the deck and either play following the above rules or pass).
If a player is unable to play, the player must draw up to 3 cards from the deck.  If the player cannot play after drawing, they are allowed to pass.
If the deck is emptied, the top card from the discard pile is retained as the base of a new discard pile and the remaining cards are shuffled and form the new deck from which players can draw.
